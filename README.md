Hi 👋🏽!

Welcome to my poc where you navigate on the blog agi bank with Playwright" by [Danilo Batista de Souza]

## Dependencies

- Playwright v1.46.0
- Node v20.14.0
- npm v10.7.0
- git v2.46.0
- VSCode 1.92.1 (Universal)
- Or use another IDE do you prefer

## Observation
1. I recommend using the same versions, or newer versions of the systems mentioned above.
2. When installing Node.js, NPM is installed automatically.
To check the versions of git, Node.js and NPM installed on your computer, execute the git --version && node --verson && npm --version command line command on your command line terminal.
3. In the list of dependencies above, I left links to find the installers below, in case you have not installed them yet.


> Pre requirements: 
- [Node setup](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- [VS Code setup](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/get-started/basics)
- [Playwright setup](https://playwright.dev/)



This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

On your terminal, type:

## Clone repo
1. ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
## Install dependencies
3. ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   
## Run the test with UI mode
2. ```sh
   npx playwright test --ui
   ```
## Run the test 
3. ```sh
    npx playwright test
   ```
